    "The \"Relative Straight Index (RSI) Five Technique\" is not a commonly known term in financial analysis. It is likely that you meant to ask about the \"Relative Strength Index (RSI)\" and how it can be calculated over a five-period window. The RSI is a popular momentum oscillator used in technical analysis to measure the speed and change of price movements.\n",

    "Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the RSI and how to calculate it using a five-period window:\n",

    "Relative Strength Index (RSI)\n",
    "Concept:\n",
    "The RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements.\n",
    "It oscillates between 0 and 100.\n",
    "Traditionally, RSI values above 70 indicate overbought conditions, and values below 30 indicate oversold conditions.\n",
    "Calculation Steps:\n",
    "Determine the Lookback Period: For a five-period RSI, use 5 periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the Gains and Losses:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each period, calculate the change in price.\n",
    "Separate the changes into gains (positive changes) and losses (negative changes).\n",
    "Calculate the Average Gain and Average Loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Gain = (Sum of gains over the lookback period) / 5\n",
    "Average Loss = (Sum of losses over the lookback period) / 5\n",
    "Calculate the Relative Strength (RS):\n",
    "\n",
    "RS = Average Gain / Average Loss\n",
    "Calculate the RSI:\n",
    "\n",
    "RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))"
